1)These constructs work as for loop in the code which the condition is checked for iterations 0,1,2,3
2)It can be used in used in cases where if-else is involved like to check the seniority level of the employees by checking te years of experience in the industry.
or in cases where switch-case is involved for in-case where choices are involved like to check binary number is True or False by the input is 1 or 0.
3)Receives values from the channel repeatedly until it is closed. at value i=5 its closed.
4)The make() function is a special built-in function that is used to initialize slices, maps, and channels.Here channel is created of buffer size 10.
